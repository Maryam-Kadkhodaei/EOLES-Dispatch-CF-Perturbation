GAMS is designed for modeling and solving linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization problems. The first presentation of GAMS was in 1976, at the International Symposium on Mathematical Programming (ISMP). It's the first algebraic modeling language (AML). GAMS is a non-free software, it has a proprietary licence.\r\n",
